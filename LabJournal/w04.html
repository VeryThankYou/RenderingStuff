    <h1>Worksheet 4</h1>
    Answers has been computed with a Python script which is also in the LabJournal folder
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    1.2585527849170446e+19 photons are emitted per second
    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    Radiant Flux: 1.68 W <br>
    Radiant Intensity: 0.13369015219719207 W/sr <br>
    Radiant Exitance: 5347.606087887683 W/m^2 <br>
    Emitted Energy in 5 minutes: 504.0 J
    <h2>Part 3</h2>
    The irradiance received in the eye = 0.13369015219719207 W/m^2
    <h2>Part 4</h2>
    The irradiance received by the table = 3.9788735772973833 W/m^2 <br>
    The illuminance received by the table = 272.5528400448708 lux
    <h2>Part 5</h2>
    The luminous intensity of the unknown light source is = 137.95918367346943 cd
    <h2>Part 6</h2>
    The diffuse radiosity of the light source is 15707.963267948966 W/m^2 <br>
    The emitted energy of the light source is = 157.0796326794897 W 
    <h2>Part 7</h2>
    The radiant exitance of the light source is 12566.3706143592 W/m^2 <br>
    The power of the light source is 125.663706143592
    <h2>Part 8</h2>
    The solid angle the sun is observed under from earth is 6.744444444444445e-05 <br>
The solid angle the sun is observed under from earth is 2.9191674361341954e-05 <br>
Since the area is 1m2, the energy received is simply the irradiance <br>
The energy received on Earth is 1382.8796166429129 W/m2 <br>
The energy received on Mars is 598.5455404444741 W/m2 <br>
In conclusion, Earth is warmer because it receives greater irradiance, and the sun appears larger in the sky due to the larger solid angle compared to Mars. As a result, Earth receives more energy than Mars, making it warmer
